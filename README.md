# splash_screen
A splash screen is a graphical control element that appears when a user opens an app or game, or visits a website. It can be a window that covers the entire screen or page, or it can be a rectangle in the center. Splash screens can serve multiple purposes, including:
Making a good first impression: A splash screen can be a company's first chance to make a positive impression on a user. It can display a logo or image, convey important information, or promote a product or service.
Providing a professional look: A splash screen can make an app look polished and professional.
Giving the app time to load: A splash screen can allow time for the app engine to load and initialize while still providing an initial experience for the user.
